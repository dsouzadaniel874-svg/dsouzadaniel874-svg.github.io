      <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Daniel Dsouza, and I am a Mechanical Engineer with experience in product design, mechanical systems, and HVAC applications. I previously worked as a Design Engineer in the R&D Department at Swegon BlueBox Private Limited, where I was involved in product development, simulation, and engineering documentation.</p>
      <p>I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Post-Graduate Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, and a Diploma in Siemens NX CAD, giving me the versatility to work effectively across both design and manufacturing domains.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am pursuing freelance opportunities in mechanical design while preparing for my MSc in Automotive Engineering in the UK. During this period, I continue to work on technical projects to enhance my practical skills and industry readiness.</p>
      <h3>⚙️ Professional Background</h3>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience solving engineering problems across both academic and industrial environments. During my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, I completed multiple internships and projects that strengthened my understanding of mechanical systems, simulation, and product development.</p>
      <p>My primary areas of interest include:</p>
      <ul><li>Mechanical system design</li><li>Automotive engineering</li><li>Thermal and HVAC systems</li><li>Product development and simulation</li></ul>
      <h3>🚀 Beyond Engineering</h3>
      <p>When I’m not working on technical projects, I focus on personal development and creative interests. I enjoy reading, watching anime and movies, listening to music, and playing video games—activities that help me stay creative, balanced, and motivated.</p>
      <h3>📬 Let’s Connect</h3>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. I encourage you to explore my work and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions, opportunities, or collaboration ideas.</p>
