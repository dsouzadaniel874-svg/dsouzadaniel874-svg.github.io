<h3>Design &amp; Development of Prototype of Robotic Sensor Network for Closed Farming Environment Monitoring (Undergraduate Capstone Project – BE Mechanical Engineering)</h3>
<p><strong>1. Project Overview</strong><br/>This project focuses on the design and development of a closed-environment farming prototype capable of growing non-native plants through automated monitoring and control. The system integrates mechanical design, robotics, electronics, sensors, and environmental modelling to maintain ideal conditions for plant growth with minimal human intervention. My primary responsibility was the complete mechanical design and fabrication of the prototype, including structural modelling, motion mechanisms, and the cooling system.</p>
<p><strong>2. Problem Statement</strong><br/>Modern agriculture faces challenges when growing crops outside their natural climate due to variations in temperature and humidity, soil moisture and nutrient availability, seasonal limitations, and inconsistent manual watering. The objective was to create a self-regulating closed farming system capable of growing sensitive crops—such as Lettuce—despite unsuitable environmental conditions like those in the Mumbai region.</p>
<p><strong>3. Engineering Approach &amp; Methodology</strong></p><ul><li>Designed mechanical structure and components in Siemens NX 11</li><li>Performed simulations &amp; analyses using NX 11 and ANSYS</li><li>Integrated environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, air quality)</li><li>Developed a precise X–Y axis water delivery system</li><li>Added a Peltier-based thermoelectric cooling system to maintain lower chamber temperatures</li><li>Programmed Arduino Mega (ATmega 2560) to process sensor data and control actuators</li><li>Conducted experimental trials with Lettuce as the test crop</li></ul>
