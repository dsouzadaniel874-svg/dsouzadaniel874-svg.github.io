<h3>Excel Technical Institute (Post Graduate Diploma)</h3><p>Before joining Swegon BlueBox, I completed the PGDM Mechanical Engineering program at ETI, where I developed industry-relevant design and plant engineering competencies. The coursework covered a range of practical engineering tools and methods such as:</p><ul><li>AutoCAD for drafting and layout</li><li>PDMS for plant modeling and design workflows</li><li>Piping Engineering fundamentals</li><li>SolidWorks for 3D part and assembly modeling</li><li>HVAC system basics and design considerations</li></ul><p>This program helped build a strong foundation for my current role in design and R&D.</p>
<h3>St. John College of Engineering &amp; Management (Professional Bachelorette Degree)</h3><p>Before starting full-time at SGCE, I was enrolled in SJCEM’s four-year BE Mechanical Engineering program, where I completed all my coursework. The program gave me a strong foundation in core mechanical engineering concepts, analytical thinking, and hands-on technical problem-solving.</p><p>My academic work covered a wide range of subjects, including:</p><ul><li>Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics</li><li>Refrigeration &amp; Air Conditioning</li><li>Strength of Materials</li><li>Kinematics &amp; Dynamics of Machinery</li><li>Production Processes, Production Planning &amp; Control</li><li>Engineering Drawing &amp; CAD</li><li>Machine Design &amp; Mechanical System Design</li><li>CAD / CAM / CAE and Press Tool Design</li><li>Mechanical Measurements, Metrology &amp; Quality Engineering</li><li>Finite Element Analysis (FEA)</li><li>Internal Combustion Engines &amp; Automobile Engineering</li><li>Power Engineering and Mechatronics</li><li>Energy Audit &amp; Management, Renewable Energy Systems</li><li>Industrial Engineering &amp; Management, Project Management</li></ul><p>This academic background strengthened my technical fundamentals and prepared me for engineering roles in both design and manufacturing.</p>
<h3>Centre of Excellence in Maritime &amp; Shipbuilding (Diploma)</h3><p>Alongside my undergraduate studies, I completed professional training in Siemens NX CAD at CEMS, where I gained hands-on experience with modern CAD/PLM systems. The coursework emphasized design modelling techniques, product lifecycle management, and collaborative engineering using Teamcenter.</p><p>Core learning areas included:</p><ul><li>Synchronous and Parametric Modelling techniques</li><li>Teamcenter usage for digital product data management</li><li>NX–Teamcenter integration workflows</li><li>Designer essentials for NX environment setup and modelling</li><li>Schedule Manager for data organization and process management</li></ul><p>This training strengthened my ability to work efficiently in industry-standard design and PLM ecosystems.</p>
<h3>CADD Centre (Workshop)</h3><p>While pursuing my BE at SJCEM, I completed a hands-on workshop conducted by CADD Centre, focused on the in-depth use of ANSYS for product analysis. The workshop covered practical simulation techniques and introduced industry-level workflows used in engineering design and validation.</p><p>Key learning areas included:</p><ul><li>Basics of FEA and simulation workflow</li><li>Static and dynamic structural analysis</li><li>Meshing techniques and model setup</li><li>Post-processing and result interpretation</li><li>Validating design decisions through simulation</li></ul><p>This workshop strengthened my understanding of simulation-driven design and enhanced my ability to evaluate product performance through engineering analysis.</p>
<h3>Ezenith (Workshop)</h3><p>During my BE studies at SJCEM, I completed a certified workshop conducted by Ezenith, focused on the Design and Development of IC Engines using DieselRK. The program was delivered with guidance from Industry R&amp;D experts and provided exposure to real-world automotive industry practices.</p><p>The workshop included both theoretical and practical training, covering:</p><ul><li>IC engine architecture and operating principles</li><li>Concepts and calculations related to engine design</li><li>Design parameters and simulation methods</li><li>DieselRK-based modelling and performance analysis</li><li>Hands-on sessions involving design, development, and evaluation of IC engine systems</li></ul><p>Throughout the training, our work was continually reviewed by experts, and I received a performance rating of Good based on my understanding and participation.</p>
<h3>St. John the Baptist High School &amp; Junior College</h3><p>I completed my schooling at SJBHS, graduating in the summer of 2016. During my time here, I built a strong foundation in academics while also developing essential discipline and leadership qualities. I was actively involved in extracurricular activities, including participation in the NCC, which helped strengthen my teamwork, confidence, and commitment to personal growth.</p>
